## Overview
In this project we created a user-friendly weather app that provides everything you need from real-time updates, hyper-local forecasts, air quality data, viewing and managing saved locations, personalized alerts, to seamless location management. <br>

Our app empowers you to make informed decisions for every day living, going on adventures and prioritize your well-being.

## Features
1. **Permission Prompt:** Upon launching the app, a browser dialog appears asking the user for permission to access their location. This dialog is provided by the browser and is controlled by the Geolocation API.
2. **Search Functionality:** Users can search for weather information by entering the name of a city or location.
3. **Current Weather Display:** The app displays the current weather conditions, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and a brief description of the weather.
4. **Temperature Unit Selector:** Users can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit units to view temperature according to their preference.
5. **Forecast Display:** The app also provides a forecast for the upcoming days, showing the expected weather conditions and temperatures.
6. **Air Quality Index (AQI) Feature:** Provides users with a numerical representation of air quality based on the concentration of various pollutants in the air, the AQI categorizes air quality into levels ranging from "Good" to "Hazardous". Based on the category the air quality falls under users are able to make informed decisions about outdoor activities and take precautions to protect their health.
7. **Error Handling:** If there are any errors during the weather data retrieval process, the app gracefully handles them and notifies the user.
8. **Saved Locations:** Provides users with a convenient way to manage and view their saved locations along with the relevant information.


## How to Use
1. **Search:** Enter the name of a city or location in the search bar and press enter or click the search button.
2. **View Weather:** Once the search is complete, the app will display the current weather information and forecast for the specified location.
3. **Toggle Temperature Units:** Use the radio buttons to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units for temperature display.
4. **Monitor Air Quality:** Search the city to find its Air Quality Index (AQI). Once the search is complete, the concentration of pollutants will be displayed and the AQI categorizes air quality into levels ranging from "Good" to "Hazardous".
5. **Saved Locations:** On the home page, just below the search bar, there is a drop-down bar giving options for users to categorize the city as either favorites, starred places, want to go, to travel. They can find their selection in the saved locations page.


## Technologies Used
